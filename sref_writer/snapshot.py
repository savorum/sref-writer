"""The pinned SREF release this writer emits against.

The pinned 0.4.0 released snapshot (schemas and unit registry) is vendored
under `_vendor/` inside the package and read through `importlib.resources`,
so an installed wheel can find it.

The snapshot is verified against its manifest's digests on load, so a
snapshot edited in place is a load error rather than a quiet change in what
this writer refuses to emit.

Only the registry is consulted at runtime; the schemas ship as part of the one
snapshot artifact.
